        <h2>Channel Firing</h2>
        <p>That night your great guns, unawares,
            <br>
            Shook all our coffins as we lay,
            <br>
            And broke the chancel window-squares,
            <br>
            We thought it was the Judgment-day
            <br>
            </p>
        <p2>And sat upright. While drearisome
            <br>
            Arose the howl of wakened hounds:
            <br>
            The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,
            <br>
            The worms drew back into the mounds,
            <br>
        </p2>
        <p3>
            <br>The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, “No;
            <br>
            It’s gunnery practice out at sea
            <br>
            Just as before you went below;
            <br>
            The world is as it used to be:</p3>
        <br>
        <p4><br>“All nations striving strong to make
            <br>
            Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters
            <br>
            They do no more for Christés sake
            <br>
            Than you who are helpless in such matters.</p4>
        <br>
        <p5><br>“That this is not the judgment-hour
            <br>
            For some of them’s a blessed thing,
            <br>
            For if it were they’d have to scour
            <br>
            Hell’s floor for so much threatening....</p5>
        <br>
        <p6><br>“Ha, ha. It will be warmer when
            <br>
            I blow the trumpet (if indeed
            <br>
            I ever do; for you are men,
            <br>
            And rest eternal sorely need).”</p6>
        <br>
        <p7><br>So down we lay again. “I wonder,
            <br>
            Will the world ever saner be,”
            <br>
            Said one, “than when He sent us under
            <br>
            In our indifferent century!”</p7>
        <br>
        <p8><br>And many a skeleton shook his head.
            <br>
            “Instead of preaching forty year,”
            <br>
            My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,
            <br>
            “I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.”</p8>
        <br>
        <p9><br>Again the guns disturbed the hour,
            <br>
            Roaring their readiness to avenge,
            <br>
            As far inland as Stourton Tower,
            <br>
            And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.</p9>
