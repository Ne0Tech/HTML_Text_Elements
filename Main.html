        <p>That night your great guns, unawares,
            <br>
            Shook all our coffins as we lay,
            <br>
            And broke the chancel window-squares,
            <br>
            We thought it was the Judgment-day

            It’s gunnery practice out at sea
            <br>
            Just as before you went below;
            <br>
            The world is as it used to be:</p3>
