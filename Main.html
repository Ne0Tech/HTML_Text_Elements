        <p>That night your great guns, unawares,
            <br>
            Shook all our coffins as we lay,
            <br>
            And broke the chancel window-squares,
            <br>
            We thought it was the Judgment-day
            <br>
            </p>
        <p2>And sat upright. While drearisome
            <br>
            Arose the howl of wakened hounds:
            <br>
            The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,
            <br>
            The worms drew back into the mounds,
            <br>
        </p2>
        <p3>
            <br>The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, “No;
            <br>
            It’s gunnery practice out at sea
            <br>
            Just as before you went below;
            <br>
            The world is as it used to be:</p3>
        br
        <p4><br>“All nations striving strong to make
            <br>
            Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters
            <br>
            They do no more for Christés sake
            <br>
            Than you who are helpless in such matters.</p4>
        <br>
        <p5><br>“That this is not the judgment-hour
            <br>
            For some of them’s a blessed thing,
            <br>
            For if it were they’d have to scour
            <br>
            Hell’s floor for so much threatening....</p5>
